# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository was created as a container for all my HTML and CSS Projects during the training at Pitman Training.

I was told that creating this repository will be a vital action in creating my online portfolio and will be an extremely valuable tool for my job search. By completing my training, I expect from myself to be proficient in utilizing GitHub. This is the proof that I gained my  proficiency through experience.
