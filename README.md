# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository was created as a container for all my HTML and CSS Projects during the training at Pitman Training.

I was told that creating this repository will be a vital action in creating my online portfolio and will be an extremely valuable tool for my job search. By completing my training, I expect from myself to be proficient in utilizing GitHub. This is the proof that I gained my  proficiency through experience.

Update (december 2024)
This directory includes now, beyond many challenges in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap, 4 websites created using these programming languages. In order of their creation:
  * The Perfect Holiday (Basic_HTML_and_CSS_Website): This page is an example of a home page for a holiday booking website. It's styled using CSS, and includes a navbar, images containers and a form. 
  * Polenta's Meetings (One_page Website): Similar to the previous one (The Perfect Holiday). This page is an example of a home page for a website with recipes that include polenta. It's styled using CSS, and includes a navbar, images containers and a form.
  * Escape City (bootstrap4_project): This page is an example home page for a short trip booking website. It's styled using Bootstrap4 and contains many Bootstrap components, including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards and dropdowns.
  * The programmer Symphony (Portofolio_Website): This is my first live website (http://GaspalCatalin.github.io). It's styled and animated using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.
